# WHAT EACH PROGRAM DOES

### 0-object_like_macro.h
This is a header file which defines a macro `SIZE` and assigns it the value `1024` as it's token. When ever this header file is included, and the identifier `SIZE` is used at any point in the code, once the code is compiled and the preprocessor runs through the code, the preprocessor will replace every occurrence of `SIZE` with `1024`.

### 1-pi.h
This is a header file which defines a macro `SIZE` and assigns it the value `3.14159265359` as it's token. When ever this header file is included, and the identifier `PI` is used at any point in the code, once the code is compiled and the preprocessor runs through the code, the preprocessor will replace every occurrence of `PI` with `3.14159265359`.
