# What Each Program Does?

### 0-print_dlistint.c
This contains the function `print_dlistint` which takes a pointer to the head node of a D.L.L `h` and uses that to print out all the contents of the list.

### 1-dlistint_len.c
This contains the function `dlistint_len` which takes a pointer to the head node of a D.L.L `h` and uses that to count the number of nodes on the list and then returns the number of nodes.

### 2-add_dnodeint.c
This contains the function `add_dnodeint` which takes a pointer to the address of the head node of a D.L.L and the data to be added to the D.L.L , creates a new node, adds the data to the new node, adds the new node to the beginning of the D.L.L and then returns the address of the new node. If it fails, the function returns `NULL`.

### 3-add_dnodeint_end.c
This contains the function `add_dnodeint_end` which takes a pointer to the address of the head node of a D.L.L and the data to be added to the D.L.L, creates a new node, adds the data to the new node, adds the new node to the end of the D.L.L and then returns the address of the new node. If it fails, the function returns `NULL`.

### 4-free_dlistint.c
This contains the function `free_dlistint` which takes a pointer to the head node of a D.L.L and uses that to free up all the memory currently occupied by or allocated to the D.L.L during the course of the program.

### 5-get_dnodeint.c
This contains the function `get_dnodeint_at_index` which takes a pointer to the head node of a D.L.L and an index value, and returns the node at the specified index. If such node does not exist, it returns `NULL`.

### 6-sum_dlistint.c
This contains the function `sum_dlistint` which takes a pointer to the head node of a D.L.L, sums up all the data in the D.L.L and returns the sum.

### 7-insert_dnodeint.c
This contains the function `insert_dnodeint_at_index` which inserts a new node at the specified index in the D.L.L and returns the address of the new_node inserted or `NULL` if it could not be inserted at the specified index.

### 8-delete_dnodeint.c
This contains the function `delete_nodeint_at_index` which deletes a node at the specified index in the D.L.L and returns `1` if successful. If not successful, it returns `-1`.
