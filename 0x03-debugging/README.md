# WHAT I DID IN EACH OF THE PROGRAMS

### 0-main.c 
This is a program that is mean't to test if the function `positive_or_negative(int i)` already defined earlier works as expected. It runs the code and provides the function with test parameters in order to ascertain that it works as intended. In order to use it to test the function: 
**Use It With The Compiled Function:**
<pre>
Chukwuemeka@Ubuntu:~$ gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 positive_or_negative.c 0-main.c -o 0-main
Chukwuemeka@Ubuntu:~$ ./0-main
0 is zero
Chukwuemeka@Ubuntu:~$ wc -l 0-main.c
16 0-main.c
Chukwuemeka@Ubuntu:~$ _
