# WHAT EACH PROGRAM DOES

### dog.h
This header contains the definition of the `dog` struct which we use to represent a dog in our code. The struct has three members: A string to store the name of the dog `name`, A floating point number type to store the age of the dog `age` and A string to store the name of the dog's owner `owner`.

### 1-init_dog.c
This programs contains a function `init_dog` which, when compiled and run, takes four arguments: A pointer to struct dog `d`; A string for the dog's name `name`; A floating point number for the dog's age `age`; A string for the dog's owner's name `owner`. Then it uses all these arguments to initialize the instance of struct dog pointed to by `d`.
